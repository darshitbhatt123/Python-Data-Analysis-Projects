**Diwali Sales Data Analysis with Python**

Welcome to our Diwali Sales Data Analysis repository! Here, we delve into the insights derived from sales data during the festive season using Python. Diwali, the festival of lights, marks a significant surge in consumer spending, making it an opportune time to analyze sales trends.

**Objective:**
A company gave us their Diwali Sales Data, and they want us to analyse their data, and then share them the summary so that they can improve customer experience and can increase their sales/revenue.

**Technologies Used:**

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Data Collection:** Acquiring sales data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing and exploring the data to identify patterns and correlations.
4. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
5. **Modeling:** Building predictive models to forecast sales or detect anomalies.
6. **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance and refining the analysis.
7. **Insights and Recommendations:** Drawing actionable insights and making recommendations based on the analysis.

**Repository Structure:**
- **/data:** Contains the raw and processed datasets.
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks detailing the step-by-step analysis process.
- **/scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- **README.md:** Overview of the project.
